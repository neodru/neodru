The world is changing.  Data 💾  is the new gold  ,  the cloud ☁️ is the future,  cyber 💻🔒  is the new normal. 

👋 Hi, I'm @neodru and I'm on a journey to become a professional in a profession, that has yet to be created 🤷🏻‍♂️. As a life-long learner 👨🏻‍🎓 , educator  🧑🏻‍🏫 ,  tech enthusiast 🧑🏻‍💻,, entrepreneur 👨🏻‍💼 , and a proud US Army  🪖  combat veteran 🎖 , my life's purpose 🙏🏼  is to inspire 🤩  💖  and add value 💪🏼  🧠  to others.

I currently work in post-secondary education where I've been encouraging students to think 🤔 differently 🤨, disrupt traditions 🧐, embrace innovation 🔬 , and create wealth 🎗  (and not just in monetary terms). 

I want to create a future where innovations are created using a systems thinking approach, with an ethical  hacker mindset, and a user experience design perspective, which leverages data-driven decisions, that embraces the human element.

I consider myself a career creator, rather than a career changer as the role I'll play in the future will be created rather than filled. 

- 👀 I’m interested in artifica intelligence
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ethical hacking and software & mobile application development.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on enahcing the humnan experience, not replace it, through technology.
